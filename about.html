			My love and passion for movement started at an early age and was, in part, inspired by my dad who was a gymnast and my mother who loves to dance. During my adolescent in Jacksonville, Florida, I took ballet, tap and jazz classes for a few years, was in several school plays, in the summers went to different camps to learn skills such as baton, hula hooping and tumbling and am partially self-taught gymnast. 
				<br/>	 
			&emsp;In 1994, was a flier for the Jacksonville Pop Warner squad, and placed at competitions. Around the same time, was a part of the school softball team for two years. In 1998-2002 in Benicia, CA, I began belly dancing and performed with troupes throughout the Bay Area. 
				<br/>
			&emsp;I moved to Portland in 2002, were I began performing solo belly dancing around town and with a vaudeville group called The Ice Cream Socialist at the Devil's Point. In the summer of 2002, I joined the Sprockettes after seeing them at the Multnomah County Bike Fair. I dedicated the following three years, as a full time performer, to inspiring the youth with mini-bike dancing. After a year of overlap with the Sprockettes and Kaz&uuml;m, I decided to put all my love and energy into Kaz&uuml;m.
				<br/>	
			&emsp;In late 2005, Uli started Kaz&uuml;m and I helped to build the foundation. In 2006, I started teaching young children gymnastics for a couple of years at local gyms, went on tour with Kaz&uuml;m for nearly a month and taught partner acrobalancing workshops. In the fall of 2008 I went on maternity leave and then rejoined Kaz&uuml;m in 2010.
				<br/>
			&emsp;Currently, I live in Portland with my husband and our soon-to-be three year old daughter and perform full time with Kaz&uuml;m. 
				<br/>
			&emsp;Born with scoliosis, I've defied what one is suppose to be able to do with a huge curve in the back. My mission is to keep my body strong and flexible, encourage others to live out their dreams no matter what and to know it is never to late to start doing what you love.

  		 <dd>Since moving to Portland I've been involved with several performance troupes and I founded Kaz&uuml;m in late 2005. I have dedicated myself for many years, faced extreme challenges and experienced immense wonder in my work with Kaz&uuml;m. Now, I have a daughter and a family, with whom I am happy to share this world.
  		 	<br/>
  		 &emsp;My goal is to continue to create and hone my crafts, to make Kaz&uuml;m a professonal and established entity, and ultimately, to uplift the spirit of humanity.
  		 	<br/>
  		 &emsp;Since childhood, I've been a visual artist and very physically active. I've been passionate about drawing and photography my whole life. I have also studied yoga, pilates, trapeze, and dance. I found a lovely way to combine these two aspects of myself when I discovered acrobalance, which lead to discovering adagio, cheerleading-style stunting, and a passion for creating choreography.
  		 	<br/>
  		 &emsp;My roots are in Texas, primarily in Austin and the Hill Country where I was raised by a family of artists. I moved around countless times. After High School I traveled for years, first all over the United States and then throughout Europe. I finally found my home in 2002 when I accidentally landed in Portland.

  		 Briefly, I'm a big base. Besides bouncing bodies about like basketballs, I banter and bandy with ballerinas and bemuse bystanders. Basically, I bring the business. I also bake.
  		 	<br/>
  		 &emsp;At some point in my life, I'd like to be in a lot of trouble, so that I can get myself out of a lot of trouble. Something like Mad Max trouble. It would also be cool if there were a lot of people in trouble, and I could get us all out of trouble. Then I'd be like a superhero. Something like Mad Max.
  		 	<br/>
  		 &emsp;I will eat all your food. Om nom nom.
  		 	<br/>
  		 &emsp;A fine subject, indeed! Takes me back to grade school. I particularly enjoyed the Civil War (known to some as "The War of Northern Aggression") and the jazz and literature movements of the mid-1900's.
